# /Yarning Desire/

This is a simple, purely front-end, React/Redux application with more emphasis on styling/CSS proficiency.

# How long did it take?

Yarning Desire was developed over the course of about 7 days. It lacks some functionality, such as checking out or a seeded database to draw data from, but is a good foundation for a general purpose e-commerce store.

# What languages are used?

Almost entirely Javascript, with associated libraries and frameworks (React, Redux, Router, etc.)

# What do you want to add? What would make it better?

A back-end portion would really flesh this out. Integrating user logins as well as a checkout system ties the whole system together.

Thanks for reading me.
